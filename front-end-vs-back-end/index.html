			<h2>Front End Programming VS. Backend Programming</h2>
    		<h3 class="subheading">Which one?</h3>

			<p>Programming is the art of creating computer software. There have been many debates whether front end programming or backend programming is more useful. Front end programming deals with the actual app itself and backend programming deals with the network and the servers that support that app, website, engine, or websocket is running on. Front end programming is propably more useful because more people worry about the actual app and/or using the actual website, than worrying about the server. 
			<br><br><br>
			We can see that front end programming is the thing that makes our websites beautiful, and makes our apps beautiful, this is shown by udacity, “The front end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to drop down menus and sliders, is a combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being controlled by your computer’s browser”(Michael Wales 1). This is showing that everything that is styled on the site, is styled with front end programming. Most people probably want to see the effects. They also can’t see the server anyway.
			<br><br><br>
			While we think that the front end is more important than backend, backend is still pretty important. That is where all of the data of a website is stored and all of the servers and network. Without it, your website wouldn’t run. According to udacity, it says, “The back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place” (Michael Wales 1).

			This shows that front end programming is mainly more important than backend programming.
